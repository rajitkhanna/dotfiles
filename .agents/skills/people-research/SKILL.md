# People Research

## Prerequisites

- Exa MCP server installed and reachable
- A people-search tool exposed by your harness (name can vary)

If the required Exa tool is unavailable, tell the user:

> You need Exa MCP configured with the advanced web search tool.
> Instructions: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/exa-mcp

Then stop.

## Harness-Agnostic Tooling

- Use your harness's Exa advanced search tool (often named similar to `web_search_advanced_exa`)
- Use agent/subagent orchestration if available
- Keep raw search payloads out of the main context

Do not depend on Claude-specific or OpenCode-specific command names.

## Tool Restriction (Critical)

ONLY use `web_search_advanced_exa`. Do NOT use `web_search_exa` or any other Exa tools.

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa searches in main context. Always spawn Task agents:

- Agent runs Exa search internally
- Agent processes results using LLM intelligence
- Agent returns only distilled output (compact JSON or brief markdown)
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## Dynamic Tuning

No hardcoded `numResults`. Tune to user intent:

- User says "a few" -> 10-20
- User says "comprehensive" -> 50-100
- User specifies number -> match it
- Ambiguous? Ask: "How many profiles would you like?"

## Query Variation

Exa returns different results for different phrasings. For coverage:

- Generate 2-3 query variations
- Run in parallel
- Merge and deduplicate

## Categories

Use appropriate Exa `category` depending on what you need:

- `people` -> LinkedIn profiles, public bios (primary for discovery)
- `personal site` -> personal blogs, portfolio sites, about pages
- `news` -> press mentions, interviews, speaker bios
- No category (`type: "auto"`) -> general web results, broader context

Start with `category: "people"` for profile discovery, then use other categories or no category for deeper research on specific individuals.

### Category-Specific Filter Restrictions

When using `category: "people"`, these parameters cause errors:

- `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate`
- `startCrawlDate` / `endCrawlDate`
- `includeText` / `excludeText`
- `excludeDomains`
- `includeDomains` - LinkedIn domains only (for example `linkedin.com`)

When searching without a category, all parameters are available (but `includeText` / `excludeText` still only support single-item arrays).

## LinkedIn

Public LinkedIn via Exa: `category: "people"`, no other filters.
Auth-required LinkedIn -> use browser fallback.

## Browser Fallback

Auto-fallback to browser when:

- Exa returns insufficient results
- Content is auth-gated
- Dynamic pages need JavaScript

## Examples

### Discovery: find people by role

```json
{
  "query": "VP Engineering AI infrastructure",
  "category": "people",
  "numResults": 20,
  "type": "auto"
}
```

### With query variations

```json
{
  "query": "machine learning engineer San Francisco",
  "category": "people",
  "additionalQueries": ["ML engineer SF", "AI engineer Bay Area"],
  "numResults": 25,
  "type": "deep"
}
```

### Deep dive: research a specific person

```json
{
  "query": "Dario Amodei Anthropic CEO background",
  "type": "auto",
  "numResults": 15
}
```

### News mentions

```json
{
  "query": "Dario Amodei interview",
  "category": "news",
  "numResults": 10,
  "startPublishedDate": "2024-01-01"
}
```

## Output Format

Return:

1. Results (name, title, company, location if available)
2. Sources (profile URLs)
3. Notes (profile completeness, verification status)

## Generic MCP Configuration

Register an Exa MCP HTTP server that exposes:

`web_search_advanced_exa`

Endpoint:

`https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?tools=web_search_advanced_exa`

Use your harness-specific config format and auth mechanism.

## Post-Install Note

After adding or changing MCP or skill config, restart your agent/CLI session so tool registry refreshes.
